/**
 * \file          perform.cpp
 *
 *  This module defines the base class for the performance of MIDI patterns.
 *
 * \library       sequencer64 application
 * \author        Seq24 team; modifications by Chris Ahlstrom and Tim Deagan
 * \date          2015-07-24

 *
 *  This class is probably the single most important class in Sequencer64, as
 *  it supports sequences, playback, JACK, and more.
 *
 * Requests for more MIDI control:
 *
 *  "On a rather selfish note, I'd love to be able to send these mods from my
 *  shiny new (AKAI APC MINI) control surface:
 *
 *      - Arm for Recording
 *      - Solo On (compare it to the Replace functionality)
 *      - Solo Off
 *
 *  "Solo might not even be necessary as we have Replace. It would make sense
 *  if it allowed a temporary solo which could then be released and the
 *  original state would return. I don't exactly know how this would work,
 *  however."
 *
 *  "A MIDI mod to toggle the recording of incoming MIDI data would be an
 *  amazing step toward not having to touch the mouse. I guess a mod for MIDI
 *  pass through would also be required?"
 *
 *  "And then, actually, Start/Stop via MIDI would be something very
 *  valuable."
 *
 *  "Waiting OSC avaibility, I use
 *  https://github.com/Excds/seq24-launchpad-mapper for my Launchpad Mini."
 *
 *  We summarize the these state-saving buffers.
 *
 *      -   m_armed_statuses[c_max_sequence].
 *          Used in perform::toggle_playing_tracks(), a feature copped from
 *          the Seq32 project. Flagged by m_armed_saved.
 *      -   m_seqs_active[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Indicates if a pattern has any data in it, i.e. it is not empty,
 *          whether it is muted or not.
 *      -   m_was_active_main[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_main().
 *      -   m_was_active_edit[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_edit().
 *      -   m_was_active_perf[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_perf().
 *      -   m_was_active_names[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in perform::is_dirty_names().
 *      -   m_sequence_state[c_max_sequence] (seq24).
 *          Used in unsetting the snapshot status (c_status_snapshot).
 *          perform::save_playing_state() uses this to preserve the playing
 *          status.
 *      -   m_screenset_state[c_seqs_in_set]
 *          Holds the state of playing in the current screen-set, to determine
 *          which patterns follow the queued-replace (queued-solo) feature,
 *
 *  m_playscreen.  In seq24, this value (called m_playing_screen) is used for
 *
 *          -   select_group_mute(), to get the sequence/pattern offset for
 *              copying the pattern playing status into the mute-group array.
 *          -   select_mute_group(), very similar.  In sequencer64, this is
 *              called set_and_copy_mute_group() to avoid confusion.
 *              Also, tdeagan's code swaps m_screenset for this value.
 *          -   mute_group_tracks(), to implement the mute-group operation.
 *              Also, tdeagan's code swaps m_screenset for this value.
 *          -   sequence_playing_on()/_off().  If this value equals
 *              m_screenset and the sequence is within the playing screen,
 *              then its mute state is set to true/false (on/off).
 *          -   set_playing_screenset(), where this value is set to
 *              m_screenset.  This function is called when
 *              -   c_midi_control_play_ss is performed.
 *              -   The main window hot-key for screen-set is pressed.
 *
 *  m_screenset.  In seq24, this value (called m_screen_set) is used for
 *
 *          -   In set_screenset().  The value is clipped to 0 to 31.
 *          -   set_playing_screenset(), as noted above.
 *          -   sequence_playing_on()/_off(), as noted above.
 *
 *  set_playing_screenset().  This function is called when
 *
 *      -   c_midi_control_play_ss is performed.
 *      -   The main window hot-key for screen-set is pressed.
 *
 *      I think we may need to call this after calling set_screenset(seq),
 *      where a number is available.
 *
 *  set_screenset().  This function is called
 *
 *      -   In decrement_ and increment_screenset().
 *
 *      In mainwnd::timer_callback(), the mainwid screen-set is set to match
 *      the new value, which can be altered by the screen-set up and down
 *      hot-keys.

 *  (patterns) can potentially have different beats/measure and beat-width
 *  values.
 *
 *  Currently, when reading the MIDI file, the beats/minute value is obtained
 *  from the MIDI file, if present, and this value is passed to
 *  perform::set_beats_per_minute(), which forwards it to the master MIDI buss
 *  and JACK assistant objects.  This Tempo setting comes from both the
 *  Tempo meta event in track 0, and from the Seq24's c_bpm SeqSpec section!
 *  This setting is now also made for the two Time Signature values.
 *
 *  But note that Sequencer64 now scales the c_bpm value so that two extra
 *  digits of precision can be saved with the MIDI file.  We went throughout
 *  the code, changing BPM from an integer to a double.

 *      accessor function.

/**
 *  Adds a pattern/sequence pointer to the list of patterns.  No check is made

 *  pointer is officially logged.
 *
 *  This function checks for the preferred sequence number.  This is the
 *  number that was specified by the Sequence Number meta-event for the
 *  current track.  If the preferred sequence number is in the valid range (0
 *  to m_sequence_max) and it is not active, add it and activate it.
 *  Otherwise, iterate through all patterns from prefnum to m_sequence_max and
 *  add and activate the first one that is not active, and then finish.
 *
 *  Finally, note that this function is used only by midifile, when reading in
 *  a MIDI song.  Therefore, the "is modified" flag is <i> not </i> set by
 *  this function; loading a sequence from a file is not a modification that
 *  should lead to a prompt for saving the file later.
 *
 * \todo
 *      Shouldn't we wrap around the sequence list if we can't find an empty
 *      sequence slot after prefnum?
 *
 * \todo
 *      This function needs some deeper analysis against the original, in my
 *      opinion.
 *
 * \warning
 *      The logic of the if-statement in this function was such that \a
 *      prefnum could be out-of-bounds in the else-clause.  We reworked
 *      the logic to be airtight.  This bug was caught by gcc 4.8.3 on CentOS,
 *      but not on gcc 4.9.3 on Debian Sid!

 *              a rewind (but currently seqroll doesn't rewind until Play is
 *              clicked, a minor bug).
 *          -#  Pause.  Same processing as Play or Stop, depending on current
 *              status.  When stopping, the progress bars in seqroll and
 *              perfroll remain at their current point.
 *      -#  perfedit.
 *          -#  Play.  Override the current perform song-mode to use "Song".
 *          -#  Stop.  Revert the perfedit setting, in case play is restarted
 *              or resumed via mainwnd.
 *          -#  Pause.  Same processing as Play or Stop, depending on current
 *              status.
 *       -# ALSA versus JACK.  One issue here is that, if JACK isn't "running"
 *          at all (i.e. we are in ALSA mode), then we cannot be JACK Master.
 *

 *      flag, which is true for Song mode, and false for Live mode.  False
 *      disables Song mode, and is the default, which matches seq24.
 *      Generally, we pass true in this parameter if we're starting playback

 *  If JACK is not running, call inner_stop().  The logic seems backward here,

 *  misunderstand the meaning of m_jack_running?
 *
 * Stazed:
 *
 *      This function's sole purpose was to prevent inner_stop() from being
 *      called internally when JACK was running... potentially twice.
 *      inner_stop() was called by output_func() when JACK sent a
 *      JackTransportStopped message. If seq42 initiated the stop, then
 *      stop_jack() was called which then triggered the JackTransportStopped
 *      message to output_func() which then triggered the bool stop_jack to
 *      call inner_stop().  The output_func() call to inner_stop() is only
 *      necessary when some other JACK client sends a jack_transport_stop
 *      message to JACK, not when it is initiated by seq42.  The method of
 *      relying on JACK to call inner_stop() when internally initiated caused
 *      a (very) obscure apparent freeze if you press and hold the start/stop
 *      key if set to toggle. This occurs because of the delay between
 *      JackTransportStarting and JackTransportStopped if both triggered in
 *      rapid succession by holding the toggle key down.  The variable
 *      global_is_running gets set false by a delayed inner_stop() from JACK
 *      after the start (true) is already sent. This means the global is set
 *      to true when JACK is actually off (false). Any subsequent presses to
 *      the toggle key send a stop message because the global is set to true.
 *      Because JACK is not running, output_func() is not running to send the
 *      inner_stop() call which resets the global to false. Thus an apparent
 *      freeze as the toggle key endlessly sends a stop, but inner_stop()
 *      never gets called to reset. Whoo! So, to fix this we just need to
 *      call inner_stop() directly rather than wait for JACK to send a
 *      delayed stop, only when running. This makes the whole purpose of this
 *      stop() function unneeded. The check for m_jack_running is commented
 *      out and this function could be removed. It is being left for future
 *      generations to ponder!!!
